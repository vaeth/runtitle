Scripts to run commands and set the hard status line (windows title)

For installation, copy the content of bin/ in your path.
To obtain support for zsh completion, you can copy the content of zsh/
into a directory of zsh's $fpath

This project contains two simple scripts:

run:
Runs a command, setting the title and ringing the bell if command fails.
There are options to repeat the command (a number of times or if it fails).
Use run -h to obtain a description.

title:
Sets the hard status line if the terminal supports it.
Use title -h to obtain a description.

If you do not give a text to "title", nothing is printed
(pass an empty text if you want to clear the status line).

You can source "title" into a POSIX shell with
TitleInit() {
	. title "${@}"
}
Then the function "TitleInit" can be used with the same meaning as "title",
(but can be used repeatedly without restarting title).
Moreover, after "TitleInit" the function "Title" can be used (also repeatedly)
to set the title according to the options of "TitleInit".
